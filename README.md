This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's onAuthStateChanged listener: not unsubscribing properly. The `authBug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `authSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  Failing to unsubscribe can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior in your application. Always ensure you unsubscribe from Firebase listeners when they are no longer needed, especially in components that unmount.
